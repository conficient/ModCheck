# ModCheck Data

## Version 330

The `scsubtab.txt` and `valcados.txt` files originate from Vocalink. These are a substitution 
and modulus checking file respectively. These change slightly with each updated version. The 
current versions here are a few months old and will be updated once the code is building and 
validating correctly.

The Excel file `testCases.xls` contains a list of the test cases used to check the library
is working as per the Vocalink specification. The values are input and an Excel formula
generates a line of Javascript for the test code.
